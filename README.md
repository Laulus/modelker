# Variance
The first step of the model is to estimate true aged of fish based on the analysis of variance.
The simpliest way is to consider there is no effect of environement on ae detremination, only scales and reader effect. Once this variance is estimated, true age of fish are recalculated based on that assomption. 
For being more accurate, this step shoul be done by separating TS and TM because mainly age at migration is biased. 

Estimation of the position of each annuli at each age +:- their variance, to be used in the backcalculation

# Backcalculation

# Growth model
-> use direct data (micrometer growth read on scale + errors )
-> use of backcalculated data
Growth model by phenotype (warning : sedentary growth only !) by rivers

# Reaction norm
-> use of backcalculated data
